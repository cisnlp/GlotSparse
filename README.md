If you are a website/dataset owner and do not want your data to be included in this table, please send us an email at amir@cis.lmu.de .

## Ethical Considerations
1. Biases: The text corpus may reflect the perspectives, opinions, or demographics of its sources or creators. It is important for users to critically evaluate the text in context especially for news sources and social medias.

2. Representativeness: While we have aimed for diversity and inclusivity, the text corpus may not fully represent all native speakers. Users should be mindful of any potential underrepresentation.

3. Ethics: We acknowledge that the collection and use of text data can have ethical implications. We have strived to handle the data responsibly, but we encourage users to consider the broader ethical implications of their own research or applications.

4. We respect robots.txt, https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html
